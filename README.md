# karabiner-rules

Rules I've written for my mouse mostly, but also to be able to "press `enter`" with my left hand.  These json files are meant to be used within the [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) application. The current local file location is:
```
~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/
```

Notes:
- [Complex modifications documentation](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/json/complex-modifications-manipulator-definition/)
- Make sure the mouse is enabled under the `Devices` tab
